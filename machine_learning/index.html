	<h1>Machine Learning</h1>

    <p> First real-world contact with Machine Learning came in 2010 at an internship at Facebook in Palo Alto</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Worked in the Ads Optimization team on improving the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction</li>
			<li>Task was to come with new features in order to better match users with ads</li>
			<li>Wrote an neural network from scratch in C++ and used it to train an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder">Autoencoder</a>
			over the sparse user text data</li>
			<li>It was one of the first neural network implementations / usages at Facebook</li>
			<li>Used k-means in order to bucket the compressed representations into a categorical feature</li>
		</ul>

    <p> Competed and won first prize in the Spoken Language Identification challenge on TopCoder -
			<a href="https://github.com/CatalinTiseanu/spoken-language-identification" target="_blank">github link</a></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Built a language classifier which received as input a 10 second mp3 and had to classify
				 the language spoken in the mp3 - amongst 176 output language classes</li>
			<li>Trained a <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html" target="_blank">Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)</a>
					with 2048 components, per output language (meaning 176 GMM's with 2048 components each). GMM's had a diagonal covariance
					matrix in order to speed up the training.</li>
			<li>Used logistic regression as the final step to calibrate the individual GMM's prediction</li>
			<li>Rented 5 AWS c4.8xlarge spot instances in order to train the models in time</li>
			<li>Used iPython notebooks, sklearn, AWS spot machines and  <a href="https://github.com/juandavm/em4gmm">this</a> GMM library</li>
			<li>The above was done within 2 weeks, in Summer 2015</li>
		</ul>

    <p> Competed and got 5th prize in the Master Data Management challenge on TopCoder -
			<a href="https://github.com/CatalinTiseanu/spoken-language-identification" target="_blank">github link</a></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build a deduplication model which removed duplicates from a large database of medical providers - around 500.00 rows</li>
			<li>Training data consisted of pairs which were known to be duplicates and the database containing the id,
			name, address and labels (such as 'internal medicine' or 'emergency').</li>
			<li>Used <i>blocking</i> in order to constrain the set of candidate pairs of rows to be evaluated to a manageable number</li>
			<li>Trained a Gradient Tree Boosting classifier (via <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost">XGBoost</a>) which given a pair of rows predicted if their duplicates - using the ground truth data</li>
			<li>Used the fact the the duplication relationship is transitive in order to obtain an additional improvement after the classification phase</li>
			<li>Used iPython, XGBoost, pandas, AWS spot machines and some custom C++ code for fast candidate generation</li>
			<li>The above was also done within 2 weeks, in Summer 2015</li>
		</ul>

		<p>At Alien Labs</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Built a data processing pipeline for Slack chat logs we got from users</li>
			<li>The pipeline included <i>data cleaning</i>: stopword removal, stemming, removing first names, keeping only english chat logs, etc</li>
			<li>Used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling</li>
			<li>Used fastText for text classification (predicting whether a specific chat log is design-related or just chit-chat)</li>
			<li>Used a Bidirectional LSTM for the same purpose</li>
			<li>Used Python Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Amazon Redshift (via the Pandas connector), gensim (for LDA), pyLDAVis (in order to visualize the LDA topics), sklearn, Facebook fastText and Keras (for LSTM)</li>
		</ul>
