	<h1>Hi there, I'm Catalin Tiseanu!</h1>

    <p>I'm passionate about technology that solves real problems,
			with a knack for algorithmic, optimization or machine learning challenges. </p>

    <p>I'm a software engineer with a heavy background in algorithms and data structures,
			having worked at companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and IBM Research. </p>

		<p> I won prizes in international machine learning contests involving duplicate detection or spoken language identification
			<a href="/machine_learning">- more about machine learning</a></p>
		  <p>I qualified 3 times for the final of the TopCoder Open, Marathon Track, one of the largest discrete optimization contests
			in the world, with more than 600 competitors at the start.
		  I placed in the top 1% in the biggest algorithmic programming contests such as Google Code Jam and USAICO.
			<a href="/awards">- more about awards</a> </p>

    <p>I worked in various backend capacities at Google (user facing product),
			Facebook (feature engineering and machine learning models),
			Twitter (improving the new user experience through better follow suggestions)
			and BitDefender (designed the big data system in charge of enabling forensics). </p>

		<p>Also, I published several theoretical computer science papers in the field of string algorithms.

    <p>Finally, I think soft skills are just as important as specific technology bullets.
			I participated in various Toastmasters chapters in order to hone my English and public speaking skills,
			participated in the World Debate Championship, and I'm also continuously interested in what makes a great
			user experience. To that end, together with some friend I built the first time real-time turnout electoral map for the
			Romanian parliamentary elections, used by more than 1% of the Romanian voting population.

		<p> I have Research Master's degree in Computer Science from the
		University of Maryland, College Park under <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/">Prof. Mohammad HajiAghayi</a> and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
		University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.
