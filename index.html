	<h1>Salut! <i>(Hello)</i></h1>

    <p>I'm passionate about technology that solves real problems,
			with a knack for algorithmic, optimization or machine learning challenges,
			proven to perform under a strict timelimit.</p>

    <p>I have heavy background in algorithms and data structures,
			having worked at companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, IBM Research and BitDefender. </p>

		<p>Published several theoretical computer science papers in the field of string algorithms.
			<a href="/research">- more about research</a> </p>

		<p>Won prizes in international machine learning contests involving duplicate detection or spoken language identification
			<a href="/machine_learning">- more about machine learning</a></p>
		 <p>Three time finalist of the TopCoder Open, Marathon Track, one of the largest discrete optimization contests
			in the world, with more than 600 competitors at the start.
		  I placed in the top 1% in the biggest algorithmic programming contests such as Google Code Jam and USAICO.
		<a href="/awards">- more about awards</a> </p>

		<p>Worked in various capacities at:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Google (user facing product)</li>
				<li>Facebook (feature engineering and machine learning models)</li>
				<li>Twitter (improving the new user experience through better follow suggestions)</li>
				<li>BitDefender (designed the big data system in charge of enabling forensics)</li>
				<li>Alien Labs, (NLP on Slack Chat Logs; Search; full stack features such as external sharing and reactions)</li>
			</ul>

    <p>Soft skills are just as important as specific technology bullets:
			I participated in various Toastmasters chapters in order to hone my English and public speaking skills,
			participated in the World Debate Championship, and am continuously interested in what makes a great
			UX. To that end, I co-built the first time real-time turnout electoral map for the
			2016 Romanian parliamentary elections.

		<p> I have Research Master's degree in Computer Science from the
		University of Maryland, College Park under <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/">Prof. Mohammad HajiAghayi</a> and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
		University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.
